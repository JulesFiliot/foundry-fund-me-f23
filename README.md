## About
Educational project to learn Solidity and Foundry development. Created following the [Foundry Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Rj_WH6yLgWe7TxankiqkrkVKXIwOP42) of Patrick Collins.

This project allows people to send ETH to the contract by calling a "fund" function. The owner of the contract can then withdraw the funds using the "withdraw" function. The contract is deployed on the Sepolia testnet at this address [0xDe5a60245681F94Fb715a3d1A60134Bc31827aDa](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xDe5a60245681F94Fb715a3d1A60134Bc31827aDa).

You can notice that unit and integration tests were implemented.
